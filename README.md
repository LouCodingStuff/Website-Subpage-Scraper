# Website-Subpage-Scraper
This Python script scrapes internal links on a webpage. It prompts for a URL, sends a GET request to retrieve HTML, uses BeautifulSoup to parse and filter links. Then it prompts the user for output mode (terminal or file) to either print or write the links. Installs required modules (requests and beautifulsoup4) if not found.
